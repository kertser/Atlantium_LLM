# General Tasks:

# Errors / Things to check:
- Play with similarity scores to have more precise answers. Pictures similarity needs to be better. Or choose the best percentile score
- Continue playing with prompts, top_K and chunking to reduce hallucinations. (May be achieved with more data)
- Need to remove header and footer of pdf/doc files form chinking/indexing - it is a garbage data
