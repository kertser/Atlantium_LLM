# What is to be done:

* Make/Test docker-compose with volumes
* Add documents to db automatically (detect new document in Raw Documents)
* Upload manually (check for duplicates existing, do not process them) - need to store documents list or retrieve it from DB
* Play with similarity scores to have more precise answers.
* Play with prompts to reduce hallucinations. (May be achieved with more data)
* Check Word, txt and Excel RAG. Add image direct RAG (with context generation)
* Multimodal Input - Connect audio model (?)
* Interactive troubleshooting mode (step by step)
* Add option for "chat with live operator"
* Calculator API - connect as agent
* Think of other Agents
* Android mobile app
* Offline LLMs (quantized?)
