# General Tasks:
* rename rag_system to RAG_processor
* Test and fix docker-compose with volumes (not working properly - seems like no metadata is initialized)
* Test Webhooks
* Make Documentation
* Play with similarity scores to have more precise answers. Pictures similarity needs to be better. Or choose the best percentile score
* Continue playing with prompts to reduce hallucinations. (May be achieved with more data)
* Interactive troubleshooting mode (analyze step by step) on request
* Add option for "chat with live operator" (A button with contacts)
* Calculator API - connect as agent


# TBDs:
* Android mobile app development (TBD)
* Offline and fine-tuned LLMs (TBD)
* Multimodal Input - Connect audio model (TBD)
* Think of other Agents (Video Agent) (TBD)

# Errors:
- Improper translation of formula:
\[ \text{Relative Humidity} = \left(\frac{\text{Actual Vapor Density}}{\text{Saturation Vapor Density}}\right) \times 100 \]
