# General Tasks:
* Test and fix docker-compose with volumes (not working properly - seems like no metadata is initialized)
* Test Webhooks
* Make Documentation
* Play with similarity scores to have more precise answers. Pictures similarity needs to be better. Or choose the best percentile score
* Continue playing with prompts, top_K and chunking to reduce hallucinations. (May be achieved with more data)
* Add prompt template for Interactive troubleshooting mode (analyze step by step)
* Add option for "chat with live operator" (A button with contacts)
* Calculator API - connect as agent


# TBDs:
* Android mobile app development (TBD)
* Offline and fine-tuned LLMs (TBD)
* Multimodal Input - Connect audio model (TBD)
* Think of other Agents (Video Agent) (TBD)

# Errors:
- Rescan button (from internal folder) - seems to be a bug. Stuck in loop. Need to check
- Looks like image search is fucked-up. And entire text search as well
- Need to remove header and footer of pdf/doc files form chinking/indexing - it is a garbage data
- Convert in config INDICES and RAG_DATA to Path
- top_k * 2? Why??
