# What is to be done:

* Test docker-compose with volumes
* Search in folders and subfolders all-together in case of rag_system.py
* Play with similarity scores to have more precise answers. Pictures similarity needs to be better. Or choose the best percentile score
* Play with prompts to reduce hallucinations. (May be achieved with more data)
* Pure Text and Excel - add to the RAG. Add images directly to RAG (with context generation)
* Add actual links to the files in the text, where filenames or (link) appears.
* Multimodal Input - Connect audio model (TBD)
* Interactive troubleshooting mode (step by step) on request
* Add option for "chat with live operator" (A button with contacts)
* Calculator API - connect as agent
* Add nice avatar image in floating window. May-be video?
* Think of other Agents (Video Agent)
* Android mobile app development
* Offline LLMs (quantized?)
