# What is to be done:
* Test docker-compose with volumes (not working properly - seems like no metadata is initialized)
* Search in folders and subfolders all-together in case of rag_system.py
* Make available to be opened as source (raw) documents - Add actual links to the files in the text, where filenames or (link) appears.
* Play with similarity scores to have more precise answers. Pictures similarity needs to be better. Or choose the best percentile score
* Play with prompts to reduce hallucinations. (May be achieved with more data)
* Interactive troubleshooting mode (step by step) on request
* Add option for "chat with live operator" (A button with contacts)
* Calculator API - connect as agent


# TBD:
* Android mobile app development (TBD)
* Offline LLMs (TBD)
* Multimodal Input - Connect audio model (TBD)
* Think of other Agents (Video Agent) (TBD)
